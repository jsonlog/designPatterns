The files in bpwj.zip contain the same information that is on the
CD that comes with "Building Parsers with Java," by Steve Metsker.

After unzipping the files, open a command window and go to the bpwj
directory. (To open a command window on Windows operating systems,
click Start, click Run..., and run CMD.)

In the bpwj directory, build and execute the ShowHello program by 
executing the showhello.bat file. Once this works you should be able
to build anything of the book's programs. If it fails, you may not
have java installed. You can get a java compiler and runtime
interpreter (for free!) from java.sun.com.

You may also want to run sling.bat; this should start up the Sling
programming environment. The chapter on Sling in the book should
suffice as a user manual, but you can jump right in with the following
short but interesting program:

    plot sling(1, 1) + sling(s2, 100*s1);

If you have problems with any of the software, or if you have comments
or questions about the book, please write me at Steve.Metsker@acm.org.
